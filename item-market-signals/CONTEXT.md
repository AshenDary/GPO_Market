# CONTEXT.md

Read this before doing anything else in this repo. It is the condensed
architecture + state doc so you do not need the full chat history that
produced this project. For command recipes, see `SKILLS.md`. For the
phase-by-phase plan, see `ROADMAP.md`. For setup/usage, see `README.md`.

## What this is

Item Market Signals is a market intelligence dashboard and evaluator for the
Grand Piece Online trading economy. It combines community-solved values from
gpovalues.com with a curated tier/rarity reference, stores dated snapshots, and
turns the result into:

- current fair-value lookup with confidence bands
- asking-price verdicts: good deal, fair, slightly high, or overpriced
- snapshot-based trend context
- trade-side comparison through a simulator
- structural value-model diagnostics, low-confidence estimates, and SHAP
  explanations for the value regression model

This is a personal tool and a data science portfolio project. Both matter:
code should work correctly for real buying decisions and be defensible in an
interview. Honest uncertainty handling matters as much as the happy path.

There is no personal trade log. That was the original design and was
deliberately dropped because the user buys from sellers and does not have a
completed item-for-item trade history. Do not reintroduce a trade log as the
primary data source without being asked.

## Data sources

1. **gpovalues.com API** (primary, real prices) - public JSON API at
   `https://gpovalues.com/api/v1/items.json`, no auth. It provides solved
   `value`, `ci_low`, `ci_high`, `confidence`, `demand`, `demand_ratio`,
   `trade_count`, images, and share URLs. See
   https://gpovalues.com/legal/methodology for their value methodology.
2. **Tier/rarity reference JSON** (secondary, structural) - curated community
   tier-list data in `data/raw/gpo_market_dataset.json`. This provides
   category, tier, sub-tier, obtainability, rarity/popularity signals, aliases,
   and flags such as unstable/unobtainable. It is structural context, not price
   data.

Data flow:

1. `pull_gpovalues_snapshot.py` writes dated real-price snapshots.
2. `parse_tier_dataset.py` writes dated structural tier-reference snapshots.
3. `build_feature_matrix.py` merges the latest of each using exact normalized
   item name, then gpovalues shortcut vs tier alias. Unmatched gpovalues rows
   are kept and flagged.
4. `trend_model.py` reads all gpovalues snapshots for historical movement.
5. `value_regression.py` trains on medium/high-confidence rows, predicts
   `log(value)`, converts final predictions back with `exp`, and uses SHAP
   TreeExplainer on the selected RandomForestRegressor to explain model
   predictions in log-space.
6. The CLI and Streamlit dashboard reuse these package modules instead of
   duplicating parsing, matching, trend, or verdict logic.

The repository contains accumulated dated snapshots under `data/snapshots/`.
Check the snapshot filenames for the current coverage window instead of
treating this document as the source of truth for a fixed latest date.

`.github/workflows/daily_ingest.yml` defines the scheduled data-refresh job at
the Git root. It runs at `0 1 * * *` (1:00 AM UTC / 9:00 AM Asia/Manila) and
can also be started manually with `workflow_dispatch`. The job runs from the
`item-market-signals/` working directory on Python 3.9, installs dependencies
and the editable package, then runs:

1. `python scripts/run_ingest_gpovalues.py`
2. `python scripts/run_ingest_tier.py`
3. `python scripts/run_feature_build.py`

The final step stages `data/snapshots/*.csv` and `outputs/*.csv`, commits them
as `github-actions[bot]` with `Update daily market snapshots` only when there
are staged changes, and pushes that commit. Hosted dashboard deploy/reload
behavior is separate from this data commit workflow and should be verified in
the hosting environment.

## Current phase

The core product is built and usable on `main`: ingestion, feature merging,
CLI evaluator, dashboard, trend views, Value List, footer/navigation polish,
Trade Simulator, structural value regression, model-derived estimates, anomaly
diagnostics, and SHAP explainability are implemented.

Current work is validation, packaging, and model-quality refinement:

- monitor scheduled ingest commits and verify hosted deploy/reload behavior
  separately
- improve structural feature quality, especially prestige/item-family signals
- refine model-insight language so regression output never masquerades as
  observed value
- upgrade trend modeling once there is enough long-run history for a real
  slope/forecast instead of first-to-last deltas
- prepare portfolio screenshots/write-up around methodology and limitations

## Design principles

- **Every uncertainty-bearing calculation has an explicit guard and says so out
  loud.** Trend requires `MIN_SNAPSHOTS`; low-confidence values are caveated;
  model estimates are labeled as model-derived.
- **Observed market values beat model-derived estimates.** The regression model
  is structural context and low-confidence/tier-only support, not a replacement
  for gpovalues.
- **Log-scale model math must stay honest.** The value model predicts
  `log(value)`. Display final predictions in value units if useful, but show
  SHAP contributions as relative log-space pushes, not per-feature currency
  deltas.
- **Network fetch and parsing logic stay separated.** Tests call pure flattening
  functions against fixtures, never the live gpovalues API.
- **Unmatched/ambiguous items are flagged, never silently guessed.** Avoid fuzzy
  matching unless the output clearly marks it and the behavior is discussed.
- **Snapshots are dated and never overwritten.** This is what makes historical
  trend analysis possible.
- **Dashboard code is presentation-only.** Pages/components import package
  modules for data logic. Do not duplicate parser, matching, model, or verdict
  behavior in Streamlit for convenience.
- **`src` layout, single package root.** `config` and `market_signals` live
  under `src/`. `pip install -e .` makes them importable. Only `conftest.py`
  and thin script wrappers should compensate for a missing editable install.

## Known gotchas

- **There are two requirements files.** Keep repo-root `requirements.txt` and
  `item-market-signals/requirements.txt` in sync when adding dependencies.
- **Git root vs project folder is easy to mix up.** The repository root is
  `GPO_Market/`; the active Python project is `GPO_Market/item-market-signals/`.
  Most commands should be run after `cd item-market-signals`.
- **Typer collapses a single-command app.** Invoke the CLI as
  `python -m market_signals.evaluator.evaluate "Item Name"` with no `check`
  subcommand.
- **gpovalues names and tier-list names do not always match.** The merge tries
  exact name, then shortcut/alias. Avoid silent fuzzy matching on item names.
- **Some environments block live network.** Fixture-based tests are the source
  of truth for offline verification; live ingestion needs network access.
- **Streamlit caches can look stale.** Use the page `Refresh data` button after
  running ingestion/build scripts. For hosted Streamlit Cloud, pushes may still
  require a manual app reboot before dependency/runtime changes take effect.
- **Local Python and hosted Python may differ.** This machine currently runs
  Python 3.9; Streamlit Cloud may use a much newer runtime such as Python 3.14.
  Dependency issues can be runtime-specific, so verify both when changing
  packages like Streamlit, sklearn, Plotly, or SHAP.
- **Plotly `titlefont` is deprecated.** Use nested title dictionaries such as
  `xaxis={"title": {"text": "...", "font": {...}}}` instead of old
  `titlefont` keys.
- **Value-regression SHAP explains encoded model features.** Categorical values
  appear as one-hot feature labels like `category_X` or `obtainability_Y`.
  Interpret them as model drivers in log-space, not literal money deltas.
