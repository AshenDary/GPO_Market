# Item Market Signals

Item Market Signals is a market intelligence dashboard and evaluator for the
Grand Piece Online trading economy. It combines gpovalues.com market data with
curated tier/rarity context, stores dated snapshots, and exposes both a
Streamlit dashboard and a CLI evaluator.

The active Python project lives in [`item-market-signals/`](item-market-signals/).

## What It Includes

- gpovalues.com API ingestion into dated snapshots
- tier/rarity reference parsing from a curated JSON file
- feature merging by exact item name, then shortcut/alias fallback
- CLI value lookup with asking-price verdicts
- Streamlit dashboard with Start Here, Overview, Item lookup, Trade Simulator,
  Model Insights, Trend, and Value List pages
- snapshot-based trend context
- structural value regression for low-confidence/tier-only estimates
- SHAP explanations for the RandomForestRegressor value model, displayed as
  log-space relative contributions
- offline tests built around saved fixtures

## Quick Start

```bash
cd item-market-signals
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
pytest
```

Run the dashboard:

```bash
streamlit run dashboard/app.py
```

Run the full local data pipeline:

```bash
python scripts/run_ingest_gpovalues.py
python scripts/run_ingest_tier.py
python scripts/run_feature_build.py
```

Check one item from the CLI:

```bash
python -m market_signals.evaluator.evaluate "Prestige Candy Cane"
python -m market_signals.evaluator.evaluate "Candy Cane" --asking-price 300000
```
